1. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome, and thanks for trying out WinPSTools.

WinPSTools is a set of useful command-line utilities for Microsoft Windows that
allows a Windows user to list, find and terminate running processes.

WinPSTools consists of two programs: wps and wkill.

WinPSTools is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL). See the included LICENSE file for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. USING THE TOOLS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WinPSTools 1.5 consists of two command-line applications. Their use is outlined
in the following subsections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 FINDING RUNNING PROCESSES WITH WPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The utility to find a running process is wps. Running wps on its own, 
with no command-line arguments, will display a list of all processes
running on your Windows system. A few headings will be displayed, and
these are:
     PID      The process ID of the process.
     PPID     The PID of the process's parent.
     PRI      The priority class of the process.
     COMMAND  The name of the running program.
If you have used the ps command on UNIX, you will notice that this output
is in the same format as the output of ps.

There are several command-line options available for wps:
     -?         Shows a brief help screen with a listing of all options.
     -e <regex> Only displays processes whose names match a given regular 
                expression. By default, the regular expression is 
                case-sensitive.
     -n <name>  Only displays processes whose name matches a given process
                name. By default, the name is case-sensitive.
     -i         Specifying this option with -e or -n causes the regular
                expression or name matching to be case-insensitive.
     -p         Only displays the process ID (PID), omitting all other
                information. When used with the -e option, this behaves
                like the 'pgrep' command on UNIX systems.
     -v         Shows version and copyright information for wps.
            
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 TERMINATING PROCESSES WITH WKILL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other utility in WinPSTools is wkill. To terminate a single process,
you can find its process ID (PID) with wps as described above, or you 
can search for processes to terminate based on their name using command-
line options similar to wps.

There are three ways to terminate processes with wkill on the command line:
     wkill <process ID>    Terminates the process with the given PID, if
                           such a process exists.
     wkill -n <name>       Terminates all processes with the given name.
     wkill -e <regex>      Terminates all processes whose name matches
                           the given regular expression.
If using the -n or -e options, the comparison is case-sensitive by default.
To make these comparisons case-insensitive, you can specify the -i option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 EXAMPLE INVOCATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding a process by name:
C:\>wps -n notepad
    PID     PPID    PRI     COMMAND
    2188    1372    8       notepad.exe
    992     1372    8       notepad.exe
    1928    1372    8       notepad.exe
    3636    1372    8       notepad.exe

Finding a process by regular expression:
C:\>wps -e "^note"
     PID     PPID    PRI     COMMAND
    2188    1372    8       notepad.exe
    992     1372    8       notepad.exe
    1928    1372    8       notepad.exe
    3636    1372    8       notepad.exe    

Terminating a specified process ID:
C:\>wkill 2188
PID 2188 terminated successfully.    

Terminating a process by name:
C:\>wkill -n notepad
PID 992 (notepad.exe) terminated successfully.    
PID 1928 (notepad.exe) terminated successfully.   
PID 3636 (notepad.exe) terminated successfully.

3. KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout my testing I have not found any issues yet. Please report any
bugs or issues to me at jattardi@gmail.com, and include 'WinPsTools' in
the subject line.

4. WHAT'S NEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* WinPSTools v1.5.1 [October 26, 2006]
    - Fixed a bug where the program would crash when using certain combinations
      of command-line arguments.

* WinPSTools v1.5 [January 10, 2005]
    - Added support to search for process names using POSIX style regular 
      expressions with a new command-line option, -e. This support is thanks to 
      a Windows port of the GNU Regex library by George Carrette.
      
    - Due to the new regular expression support, the -n option now only
      matches whole names and not substrings as in previous versions. A
      reminder about this is included in the help output.
